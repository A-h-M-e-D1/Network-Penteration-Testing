# Network Security Assessment Methodology

## Reconnaissance to Identify  

### Passive Techniques  
You can use open-source intelligence (OSINT) like:  
- Web search engines  
- WHOIS databases  
- DNS servers  

To discover:  
- Networks  
- Hosts  
- Users of interest  

### Active Techniques  
You can use tools to interact directly with the network, such as:  
- `nmap`  
- `Nessus`  

## Vulnerability Scanning  
Identify potentially exploitable conditions by:  
- Identifying accessible network services that can lead to:  
  - Code execution  
  - Information leak  
  - Denial of service  
- Gathering useful information such as:  
  - ICMP messages that hosts respond to  
  - Firewall ACLs  

## Investigation of Vulnerabilities  
### Public Vulnerability Sources  
The following open sources are useful when investigating potential vulnerabilities:  
- **NIST** National Vulnerability Database  
- **Offensive-Security** Exploit Database  
- **The Full Disclosure** mailing list  
- **The HackerOne** Internet bug bounty  
- **SecurityFocus**  
- **Packet Storm**  
- **CERT** vulnerability notes  

## Exploitation of Vulnerabilities  
- Performing privileged network access  
- Gaining persistence  

### Popular Exploitation Frameworks  
- **Rapid7 Metasploit**  
- **CORE Impact**  
- **Immunity CANVAS**
